# Bamazon
Bamazon is a node.js app that will allow you to see a list of all the products available for sale in the Sql database.
The list is divided into three columns(item_id, product_name, and price).
From there, you will be asked to enter the item_id and the quantity of the product you would like to purchase.
If there is enough inventory to fulfill the order, the database gets updated and you will be given a total cost of your entire purchase.
